## Loading and preprocessing the data

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

totStepsperDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
  hist(totStepsperDay$steps, col = "pink", breaks = 10, xlab = "Number of steps    taken per day", main = "Histogram of Steps Taken Per Day")
meanSteps <- mean(totStepsperDay$steps)
medSteps <- median(totStepsperDay$steps)
meanSteps <- as.integer(meanSteps)

The mean and median of the total steps taken were r meanSteps and r medSteps.
meanSteps = 10766
medSteps = 10765

## What is the average daily activity pattern?




## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
